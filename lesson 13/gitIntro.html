        Git Introduction

        <p>Git lets us track changes in our code. It is very useful for bigger projects</p>

        <p>Set up Git</p>

        Step 1 - Creating a repository :

        <p>git symbol in vs code -> initialize repository</p>

        Step 2 - Configure a username and email with Git :

        <p>terminal -> new terminal -> git config user.name "" and git config user.email "lophymilan@gmail.com"</p>

        Step 3 - Save changes into Git [so Git will start tracking any new changes that we make]

        <p>git symbol in vscode -> type a message tellling what we change -> commit</p>

        NOTE : A repository is a folder where changes are being tracked.

        <p>Git has a really useful feature called history. Open Timeline in vs code -> filter icon -> select git history only (avoid tick mark in local history). </p>
        <p>It will show the changes we made at each time. Latest change appears first. In git, it is called version history.</p>

            JS main idea

            1. Save the data
            2. Generate the html
            3. Make it interactive


            Benefits for generating the html using JS:

            - We don't need to copy paste the html again and again for adding new info . Instead just add the new data in the variable where we Saved the data using JS (step 1).
