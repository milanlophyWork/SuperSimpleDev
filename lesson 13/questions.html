        1. Creating the quantity selector. When adding a product instead of increasing the quantity by 1, we will increase the quantity by the number in the selector.
                Steps - add a unique class to select tag to identify which product dropdown is for.(class = "js-quantity-selector-${product.id}")
                      - on clicking "Add to Cart" button, use DOM to get the quantity selector for the product. 
                      - Get the value selected in the quantity selector using property '.value'. [this value will be a string. so should convert to number first]
                      - When updating cart instead of using a quantity of 1 every time, use the quantity selected. Use the method Number() to convert the value to a number.
        2. Commit the changes to git
