        <h4>External Libraries</h2>

        External Libraries are just code that is outside of our project. Other developers write JavaScript code and put their code in internet. These code can be load into our project from internet.
        We call this code an external library.

        <p>Generally we load the external libraries first. Then we can use the library in our own code below.</p>

        Why we use external libraries ?

        <p>- let us share code </p>
        Instead of writing all code ourselves we can use code that other people wrote.

        <p>- Save time</p>
        <p>- Avoid duplicating work</p>

        Let us use DayJS external library in our Amazon project to calculate the delivery dates for each product. This is a popular
        library that helps us work with dates.

        <p>We compress our code because we need to load this code from the internet into our project. By compressing it, it makes this code smaller so it can be loaded faster.</p>
        This compression process is called Minification or we say we minify the code.

        <p>How to use external libraries ?</p>

        External libraries usually have a documentation page that shows us how to use the library. We can find the documentation page by searching on Google the 'library_name documentation' (ie dayjs documentation)
