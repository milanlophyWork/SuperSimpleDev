        <h4>How to use external libraries and javascript modules together?</h4>

        <p>We use ESM version of the library for this purpose. ESM stands for EcmaScript Module. EcmaScript is just an another name for JavaScript.
        It is a version that works with JavaScript modules.</p>

        <p>Note : Not every library has esm version. Hence for some we need to use script tag instead of importing.</p>

        <h4>Default Export</h4>

        Default export is an another way of exporting something from a file. We can use it when we want to export only 1 thing. 

        <script type="module" src="ESM.js"></script>
