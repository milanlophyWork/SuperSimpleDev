            1. In the checkout page, the header at the top always says "3 items". 
               In checkout.html, find the element that displays "3 items" and delete the text inside. It should display "Checkout()" when the page loads.
               In checkout.js, when the page loads, calculate the actual quantity of products in the cart, and display it in the heaader: `${quantity} items`
               HINTS : In amazon.js, inside the function updateCartQuantity(), we wrote some code to calculate the cart quantity. Reuse the code. In 
                    checkout.html, you will need to add a class to the element so you can select it with the DOM and change the innerHTML
            
            2. Continuing from qn 1, also calculate and display the quantity in the header when clicking 'delete'
                First, create a function updateCartQuantity() and put the code from qn 1 inside it. Run this function when loading the page and when clicking delete
                Notice that this function doesn't conflict with updateCartQuantity in amazon.js because we are using modules.

            3. If we open the home page (amazon.html) notice the cart quantity in the top-right always starts at 0. Fix it.
                Remove the text "0" (so the cart quantity starts as blank). When the page loads, calculate the cart quantity and display it in the top right. (reuse updateCartQuantity function)
                [Here what i did => calculateCartQuantity in cart.js is used to calculate quantity and updateCartQuantity just displays the quantity. calculateCartQuantity is reused.]

            4. Making 'Update' interactive.
                - In checkout.js, set all the "Update" links from the page and add a "click" event listener to each link. Also, attach the productId to each link.
                  When clicking the link, get the productId and console.log() it.
            
            5. Add 2 HTML elements after the "Update" link. An input element with class 'quantity-input' for entering new quantity and a span with class 'save-quantity-link' and a text 'Save' to
               save the quantity. Style the input and set its width to 30px. Add the class 'link-primary' to the <span>
                
            6. Make "Save" appear when clicking "Update". When clicking "Udate", get the cart-item-container for the product, and add the class "is-editing-quantity" 
               to the container (use classList).
                    - In checkout.css, style the input and 'Save' link and add display : none (they will be invisible at the start)

               Now what we did is that on clicking update a new class is added to product container whose quantity is updated
            
            7. The css ".is-editing-quantity .quantity-input{...}" styles element with class quantity-input inside an element with class "is-editing-quantity". ie, 
               this styles are applied to input element only after clicking update() [so that class 'is-editing-quantity' is added].

               Use this and style 'display: initial' (resets the display property) to make the input appear when clicking update. Same for the 'Save' link

            8. Using similar CSS selectors as qn 7, make the quantity label and "Update" link disappear when editing the quantity.

            9. Now we will implement switching between "Update" and "Save". Add "click" eventListeners to all "Save" links. When clicking "Save", do the
               opposite of "Update": get the cart-item-container for the product, and remove the class "is-editing-quantity". This should reverse all
               the styling that's applied when editing the quantity.

           10. When clicking "Save", use the DOM to get the quantity <input> for the product, and get the value inside (remember to convert this value
               to a number). This will be the new quantity of the product in the cart.
            
           11. In cart.js, create a function updateQuantity(productId, newquantity) which will find a matching productId in the cart, and update its
               quantity to the new quantity (remember to save to storage after). Then, import and use this function when clicking a "Save" link

           12. Now that we have updated the quantity in the cart, the last step is to update the quantity in the HTML. Update these 2 places:
                - In quantity label 
                - In header at the top

           13. Try to come up with more features to add to the "Update" link like : 
                - Add validation (check the new quantity is >= 0 and < 1000)
                - Add keyboard support (allow updating by pressing 'Enter')
