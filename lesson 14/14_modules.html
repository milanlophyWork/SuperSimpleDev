        Modules are better way to organize our code. 

        <p>3 script tag together in a file is similar to combining all the files together into 1 big file and running the code.Using script tag like this cause naming conflicts.</p>
        <p> For eg : we used cart variable in cart.js, so we can't use 'cart' in any other files. Modules solve this problem.</p>

        *Steps for creating a module :

        <p>1. Create a file</p>
        <p>2. Don't load the file with script tag.</p>
        By doing this any variables we create inside the file, will be contained inside the file. So it won't cause any naming conflicts.

        <p>*To get a variable out a file : </p>

        1. Add type= "module" attribute
        <p>2. Export</p> 
        3. Import

        <p> NOTE : put all imports at the top of the file. We need to use live server for modules to work [ie, if opened by double clicking the html file it won't work].</p>

        *Benefits of module : 

        <p>1. Helps us to avoid naming conflicts</p>
        2. It allows us to import a variable in a different product-name
        <p>3. Don't have to worry about the order of files.</p>

        We need one JavaScript code to load our code. This JS file will import all the other file we have created and hence is called the Entry point.
