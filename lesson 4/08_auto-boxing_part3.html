        OBJECTS MORE DETAILS : <p></p>

        Null is one of the falsy values in Js. It is similar to the value undefined. Both of them represent something that does not have a value. <p></p>
        Null is used when we intentionally want something to be empty. Like we wanna say it has no value now but I will assign this later. <p></p>
        Undefined means variable has been declared but not assigned any value yet. Null is of type object whereas undefined is of type undefined. <p></p>

        AUTO-BOXING : <p></p>

        Js automatically wraps strings, numbers , booleans in an object. This is called auto-boxing. <p></p>
        This object has properties and methods. eg: length, toUppercase(), toString(), etc. Auto-boxing won't work with null and undefined.

        <p>OBJECTS ARE REFERENCES</p>

        Objects created are stored somewhere in memory. And variable object only stores its reference. This is to make the language more efficient.

            console.log('hello'.toUpperCase())
            console.log((3).toString(), true.toString())
            */

            const obj2 = obj1 // obj2 now has copy of reference . ie now both obj1 and obj2 points to same object stored somewhere in memory.
