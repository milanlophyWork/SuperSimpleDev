<!-- HTML Attributes => change the behaviour of an element. Used when we want to style each element differently (use class attribute). eg: one button with a different style. Html attributes are put always in opening tag. Here 'title' is the attribute name and 'tooltip: button with another style is the attribute value. Here we are actually changing tooltip of button to 'tooltip: button with another style'. -->

<button title="tooltip : button with another style" class="yellow_button">Style 2</button> <!-- Tooltip is a popup tha appears on hovering an element. It gives extra information about that element. class adds a label to an element. ie this button is labelled as an yellow button. on styling a class dot is used.-->
