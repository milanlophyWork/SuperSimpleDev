            1) Create a script element. Inside the script create a variable called name and save your name in this variable (as a string)
            2) Display a msg 'My name is: ${name}' in the console (name above inserted)
            3) At a restaurant, you order 1 coffee ($5), 2 bagels ($3 each) and 1 soup ($9). Calculate the cost and save it in a variable called 'cost'
            4) Display the cost as 'Cost of food: $...' in the console.
            5) Let's say the restaurant charges a 10% tax. Using the 'cost' variable from qn 3, calculate the tax and save the result in a variable
            6) Display tax as 'Tax (10%): $...' in the console
            7) Calculate the total (cost + tax), save it in a variable called totalCost and display the msg 'Total cost: $...' in the console.
            8) In the cart quantity project add 2 more buttons '+4' and '+5', which increase the quantity by 4 and 5 on clicked (try with +=)
            9) In the cart quantity project, add a button 'Remove from cart', which decreases the cart quantity by 1
            10) Add 2 buttons '-2' and '-3' which decrease the quantity by 2 and 3
            
            open supersimple.dev/projects/calculator in browser and open console

            11) create a new file calculator.html. Add the html structure with a title Calculator
            12) Create buttons in first row in browser
            13) create a script create a variable called calculation and save an empty string inside
            14) on clicking 1 add string 1 to calulation variable and display it in console. Do the same for 2,3 and + . for + display ' + ' instead of '+'
            15) on clicking = use the code eval(calculation) [eval() converts the calculation string into actual math] . Save the result back in 'calculation' [calculation = eval(calculation)] . Display the result in the console.
            16) create the rest of the buttons in calculator. Put buttons inside <p> elements to create multiple rows

            const name= 'Milan' // use const by default always. Change if re-assignment occurs
            console.log(`My name is: ${name}`)

            const cost= 5+ 2 * 3 + 9
            console.log(`Cost of food: $${cost}`)

            const tax= (5 + 2*3 + 9) *0.1
            console.log(`Tax (10%): $${tax}`)

            const totalCost= ((5+ 2*3 + 9) + (5+ 2*3 + 9) * 0.1)
            console.log(`Total cost: $${totalCost}`)
